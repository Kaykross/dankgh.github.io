                <p>
                    CBT Exam – Computer Based Test is an assessment test which Nurses should give if they wish for a career in UK. The newly introduced CBT is a two-part examination. You only get to take the test after authorisation from <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com">Pearson Vue</a> when candidates are through with UK NMC registration and verification from their home regulatory body.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part A of the exams consist of <b>15-mark</b> numeracy questions whiles Part B is a <b>100-mark</b> clinical multiple choice questions. The candidate has to pass both parts of the CBT before they can be accepted into the NMC register for nurses. If a candidate fails either part, they need only re-sit the part they have failed.
                </p>

                    In a disciplined nation as UK, a skilled nurse or midwife is supposed to apply standard practices, kmowledge and tenets of nursing and midwifery and the CBT is done to evaluate a precise understanding of your skills & knowledge in Nursing and midwifery.
